## Description
\
\
A modern, responsive, retail e-commerce Single Page Application designed from the ground up to be user-friendly and accessible.
The page consists of 4 main components, including the **Navigation Bar**,**Product Overview**, **Related Items**, and **Ratings and Reviews** section.

During this project, I collaborated with a team of 3 other engineers and was personally responsible for designing the **Product Overview**, **Navigation Bar**, **Shopping Cart**, and **Sites Statistic** section.
